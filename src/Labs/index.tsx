This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-3">
This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
the right.
        </p>
        <p id="wd-p-4">
This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
